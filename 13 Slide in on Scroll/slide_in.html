        <div id="red-spot" class="container">
            <h4>1. The Red Spot</h4>
            <p>
                There's nothing like the idea of spiders bursting out of your face to help you sleep at night.
                <span class="img left"></span> The Red Spot, from the third Scary Stories collection, is just cruel. Everyone
                is already scared of spiders. But Schwartz's story adds another, grosser element: a spider bites Ruth on
                the face, leaving a red spot. The spot grows worse and worse over the next few days, until it finally bursts,
                releasing dozens of spiders all over Ruth's face. That's not how spiders actually work... but still.
            </p>

        <div id="big-toe" class="container">
            <h4>2. The Big Toe</h4>
            <p>
                For some reason, this is the story that stuck with me the most over the years. A little boy finds a toe in his yard,
                <span class="img right"></span> and he and his parents eat it for dinner. I mean... stop right there. Why
                are you eating a severed toe that you found in the ground? Naturally, some kind of ghost or shambling corpse
                shows up looking for its missing toe. But honestly, that kid is the real monster for being so gung-ho about
                eating human remains.
            </p>

        <div id="basket" class="container">
            <h4>3. May I Carry Your Basket?</h4>
            <p>
                Yeah, so there's a severed head in the basket.
                <span class="img left"></span> Just FYI. Sam is just trying to be nice when he offers to carry an old lady's
                basket, but of course the old lady is a headless corpse. And then she and her head chase Sam down and bite
                him. Moral of the story: never try to help anyone, ever.
            </p>

        <div id="drum" class="container">
            <h4>4. The Drum</h4>
            <p>
                So there are these two little girls, right? And they meet a third girl with a cool drum. And they really want the cool drum
                (you know, kids and their drums). Cool-drum-girl is all, "Sure you can have my drum... but only if you're
                very naughty."
                <span class="img right"></span> So the two girls start acting out, and their mother threatens to leave and
                send them a new mother who has "glass eyes" and a "wooden tail." The girls really want this drum, though,
                so of course they keep misbehaving... until they return home to find their new mother, her wooden tail thumping
                on the ground.

        <div id="pet" class="container">
            <h4>5. Samâ€™s New Pet</h4>
            <p>
                This story is actually not that scary on its own. Meet Sam, a little boy who just wants a pet to call his own. But be careful
                what you wish for.
                <span class="img left"></span> On a trip to Mexico, Sam's parents pick up a new "pet" for him... it turns
                out to be a rabid sewer rat (nice job, parents). But that illustration is so grotesquely frightening, it
                kicks up the fear factor more than a few notches.
